Create a new target folder, e.g. Human_TRB_July_2021. Copy reference from the previous target folder. Make empty samples directory
Copy and amend make_yml.bat from previous target folder
Copy ds2_filter_TRB_geno.R and change_geno_format.R from previous source folder to new source folder
Copy excel2yml python files in each previous DS source directory to new DS directories
Run ds2_filter_TRB_geno.R - this takes out the TRA in the DS2 dataset
Run change_geno_format.R - this adds the FREQ_BY_SEQ, FREQ_BY_CLONE (identical, because this is TR, therefore no clones)
Run the excel2yml python files in each DS directoy - this renames files and fixes up yml into Pnn.yml files
Run db/munge_tcr_data.py from digby_data - change run config and lines at bottom of file first
Run make_yml.bat in target directory
Edit run config for make TRB db, and run
Review output carefully, in particular look for warnings of duplicated read counts right at the start
'no genotype report' warnings mean ogrdbstats is missing
